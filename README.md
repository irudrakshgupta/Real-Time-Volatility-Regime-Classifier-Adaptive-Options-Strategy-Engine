## 🚀 Overview

A sophisticated financial analytics platform that combines real-time market data analysis, machine learning-based volatility regime classification, and adaptive options strategy recommendations. The system provides traders and analysts with actionable insights by automatically identifying market regimes and suggesting optimal options trading strategies.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Real-time Volatility Regime Classification**
  - Machine learning-powered market state identification
  - Multi-timeframe analysis (intraday, daily, weekly)
  - Continuous monitoring of SPX, VIX, IV skew, and realized volatility

- **Adaptive Options Strategy Engine**
  - Dynamic strategy recommendations based on current market regime
  - Comprehensive strategy backtesting and simulation
  - Real-time risk metrics and Greeks monitoring

- **Interactive Dashboard**
  - Live market regime visualization
  - Strategy performance tracking
  - Risk analytics and scenario simulation

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Backend Components
- FastAPI-based REST API
- PostgreSQL database for market data and regime labels
- Machine learning pipeline (Random Forest/LSTM)
- Options strategy optimization engine

### Frontend Features
- React-based responsive dashboard
- Real-time data visualization
- Interactive strategy configuration

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Redis (optional, for caching)

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Volatility Regimes

The system identifies four primary volatility regimes:

1. **Calm (Low Volatility)**
   - Characteristics: Low VIX, stable price action
   - Optimal Strategies: Calendar spreads, butterflies

2. **Trending**
   - Characteristics: Directional movement, moderate volatility
   - Optimal Strategies: Vertical spreads, risk reversals

3. **Mean-Reverting**
   - Characteristics: Range-bound, oscillating volatility
   - Optimal Strategies: Iron condors, strangles

4. **Explosive**
   - Characteristics: High VIX, rapid price movements
   - Optimal Strategies: Long straddles, backspreads

## 🧮 Machine Learning Methodology

The regime classification system employs a hybrid approach:

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Realized volatility calculations
   - IV surface metrics
   - Technical indicators
   - Market microstructure features

2. **Model Architecture**
   - Primary: Random Forest Classifier
   - Secondary: LSTM for temporal dependencies
   - Ensemble approach for robust regime identification

## 📈 Options Strategy Framework

### Strategy Selection
Strategies are selected based on:
- Current volatility regime
- Term structure analysis
- IV skew metrics
- Historical performance in similar regimes

### Risk Management
- Position sizing recommendations
- Stop-loss levels
- Greeks-based risk limits
- Portfolio-level exposure controls
